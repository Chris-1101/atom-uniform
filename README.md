# atom-uniform package

Emulate text formatting in Atom using symbols from the unicode character table's [Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols](https://codepoints.net/mathematical_alphanumeric_symbols) block. The ability to display these symbols will depend on which font is being used. Atom's default font supports most of the symbols in the `MAS` block and has good support for most generally-used symbols.

The original purpose of this package was to enable the ability to emphasise certain parts of comments, but it can be used to create italic or bold text anywhere that formatting isn't traditionally allowed.

And to point out that this is a WIP, here's the default Atom rocket being loaded with packages ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯
